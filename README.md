## About the build

This was really just an oppurtunity to familiarise myself with
                the core concepts I had been learning at the time such as:
                - Passing, deconsturcting and drilling props.
                - Modifying, passing and lifting state.
                - Working with hooks such as useRef for capturing input values,
                usEffect and useState.
