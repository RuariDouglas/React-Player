# React Music Player

React music player with functionality as expected: Play/Pause, Skip Forward/Back, Drag handler to change position in song and a library with a selection of Royalty Free study music.

## About the build

This was my first app made in React and an oppurtunity to familiarise myself with the core concepts I've been learning. Specifically, these were: 
- Props (Passing & Drilling)
- React Events
- State (Modifying, Passing & Lifting)
- UUID
- Creating & Styling Components
- Hooks (useEffect, useState, useRef)
